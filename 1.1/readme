BYTE INPUT

used for writing bytes and swaping the drive

this works by adding together all the letters you type in untill you press enter

A+A+B = 1+1+2

lower case letters are the same as upper case expect they have a 31 offset

meaning a = 32 z = 122 

note number don't work here
and will actually will negative

9+9 = -14



swap drive presets

floppy A      null = 0
floppy B      A    = 1
Harddrive A   zzO or ZZZZX = 128
